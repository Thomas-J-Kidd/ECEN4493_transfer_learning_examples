# Documentation: Transfer Learning with FastAI

This guide provides instructions on how to use the transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook demonstrates how to perform transfer learning using the FastAI library, focusing on adapting a pre-trained neural network model to a new classification task.
Prerequisites

## Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- FastAI library
- PyTorch library

## You can install FastAI and its dependencies, including PyTorch, by running:

```bash

pip install fastai
```
## Opening the Notebook

To open the notebook, navigate to the directory containing transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb and run:

```bash

jupyter notebook transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb
```
Alternatively, you can use JupyterLab:

```bash

jupyter lab transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb
```
## Notebook Structure

The notebook is structured into several sections, each performing a specific step in the transfer learning process:
1. Import Necessary Libraries

This section imports required Python packages and FastAI modules. Key imports include fastai.vision.all, which brings in all the necessary components for vision-based tasks.
2. Prepare the Dataset

Instructions on loading and preparing your dataset for training. This typically involves:

    Downloading the dataset (if not already available locally).
    Using FastAI's ImageDataLoaders to create data loaders for training and validation sets.
    Applying necessary transformations and augmentations to the dataset.

3. Load and Modify the Pre-trained Model

Steps to load a pre-trained model from FastAI's model zoo and modify it for your specific task. This includes:

    Selecting a suitable pre-trained model (e.g., resnet18, mobilenet_v2).
    Replacing the model's head with a new one that matches the number of classes in your dataset.

4. Find Optimal Learning Rate

Guidance on using FastAI's lr_find method to identify an optimal learning rate for training the model.
5. Train the Model

Instructions on how to train your model using FastAI's fine_tune method, which includes:

    Setting the number of epochs to train for.
    Specifying the base learning rate identified in the previous step.

6. Evaluate the Model

This section covers how to evaluate your trained model's performance, including:

    Viewing the training loss and accuracy metrics.
    Generating a confusion matrix.
    Visualizing top losses to understand where the model is making mistakes.

7. Export the Model

Steps to export the trained model for inference, using FastAI's export function.
Running the Notebook

To execute the notebook:

    Start at the top of the notebook and run each cell in order by pressing Shift+Enter.
    Carefully read the comments and instructions in each cell. Some cells may require you to make modifications based on your dataset or specific task.

Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:

    Ensure all prerequisites are installed and up to date.
    Verify that the dataset path is correct and accessible.
    If out-of-memory errors occur, try reducing the batch size or image size.

Conclusion

By following the steps in transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb, you'll learn how to leverage transfer learning for image classification tasks using FastAI. This approach allows you to build powerful models with less data and computational resources by adapting pre-trained models to new tasks.
