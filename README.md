# ECEN4493_transfer_learning_examples
This repository holds different examples of transfer learning methods in python notebooks and python files. 

# Python Notebook Usage with Various Libraries

This repository contains Python notebooks demonstrating the usage of three different Python libraries for transfer learning. Below, you'll find information about each library along with links to the respective notebook and documentation markdown files.

## Libraries Used:

1. **Fastai**
    - Fastai is a high-level library built on top of PyTorch, providing easy-to-use APIs for deep learning tasks.

    - [Fastai Documentation](transfer_learning_fastai.md)
    - [Fastai Notebook](transfer_learning_fastai.ipynb)

2. **PyTorch**
    - PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework known for its flexibility and dynamic computational graph construction.

    - [PyTorch Documentation](transfer_learning_pytorch.md)
    - [PyTorch Notebook](transfer_learning_pytorch.ipynb)

3. **TensorFlow**
    - TensorFlow is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Google, offering both high-level APIs (like Keras) and low-level functionalities.

    - [TensorFlow Documentation](transfer_learning_tensorflow.md)
    - [TensorFlow Notebook](transfer_learning_tensorflow.ipynb)
