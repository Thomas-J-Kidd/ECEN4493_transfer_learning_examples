# Documentation: Transfer Learning with PyTorch

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to use the transfer_learning_pytorch.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook is designed to demonstrate transfer learning using PyTorch, focusing on adapting a pre-trained model for a new image classification task.
Prerequisites

## Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

    Python 3.8 or later
    Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
    PyTorch and torchvision libraries

Install PyTorch and torchvision by following the instructions on the official PyTorch website.
## Opening the Notebook

Navigate to the directory containing transfer_learning_pytorch.ipynb and launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash

jupyter notebook transfer_learning_pytorch.ipynb
```
or
```bash

jupyter lab transfer_learning_pytorch.ipynb
```

## Notebook Structure

The notebook consists of several key sections, each dedicated to a step in the transfer learning process:
## 1. Importing Libraries

This section includes importing necessary Python packages and PyTorch modules:

```python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torchvision import datasets, transforms, models

    torch is the main PyTorch module.
    torch.nn and torch.optim for building the model and setting up the optimizer.
    datasets, transforms, and models from torchvision for data loading/preprocessing and accessing pre-trained models.
```
## 2. Data Preparation

Details on preparing your dataset for training, including downloading, transforming, and loading data:

```python

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
])

train_dataset = datasets.ImageFolder('path_to_train_data', transform=transform)
train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(train_dataset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

    Use transforms for image resizing, cropping, conversion to tensor, and normalization.
    ImageFolder for loading data assuming directory structure represents labels.
    DataLoader for batching, shuffling, and preparing data for training.
```
## 3. Loading and Modifying the Pre-trained Model

Explains how to load a pre-trained model and modify it for a new task:

```python

model = models.resnet18(pretrained=True)
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False  # Freeze parameters to avoid updating them

num_ftrs = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_ftrs, num_classes)  # Replace the last layer

    Loading a pre-trained ResNet-18 model.
    Freezing the model parameters to reuse learned features without altering them.
    Modifying the final fully connected layer to match the number of classes in the new task.
```
## 4. Model Training

Covers setting up the loss function, optimizer, and the training loop:

```python

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.fc.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    Configuring the cross-entropy loss for classification.
    Using SGD optimizer for updating the model's final layer parameters.
    Iterating over epochs and batches, performing backpropagation and parameters update.
```
## 5. Evaluation and Testing

Guides on evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset:

```python

correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for inputs, labels in test_loader:
        outputs = model(inputs)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print(f'Accuracy: {100 * correct / total}%')

    Using torch.no_grad() to disable gradient calculation for evaluation.
    Calculating accuracy by comparing predictions with true labels.
```
## 6. Conclusion and Next Steps

Suggestions for further exploration, such as trying different architectures, tuning hyperparameters, or applying more sophisticated data augmentation techniques.
Running the Notebook

Execute each cell sequentially in Jupyter, paying attention to cell outputs and any instructions or comments within the code. Adjust paths and hyperparameters as necessary for your specific dataset and computational resources.
Troubleshooting

Common issues may include path errors, CUDA out-of-memory errors, and mismatches in expected input sizes for the model. Ensure paths to datasets are correct, consider reducing batch size or image size for memory issues, and verify the model architecture aligns with your data preprocessing steps.
